      <h1> Trans Ally Resources </h1>
      <p> This resource list is designed to be read top to bottom (assuming you are starting your trans allyship journey here). Basic trans allyship is at the top, and things get more advanced as you move down the page.</p>
      <p>I recommend focusing on things I have placed in named sections, as these are my favorite resources for that topic. There are also more resources at the bottom, which are good reads but I did not want to clutter up the main resource list. </p>
