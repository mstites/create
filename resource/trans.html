      <h1> Trans Resources </h1>
      <p> Resources for transgender or questioning people. My resources tend to lean more towards trans feminine people as I am trans feminine, however many resources are applicatable to any trans or questioning person.</p>
      <p>This is a work in progress. Please feel free to reach out with any suggestions or feedback. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="row linkList">
      <h2>Am I trans?</h2>
      <p> There is no one who can approve you as being trans. There is no test or trans judge who can tell you. Only you can truly know. As daunting as this sounds, you don't have to figure it all out at once.</p>
      <p>It is perfectly okay to explore labels/pronouns/names without any strings attached. You can come out as one thing to later discover you are another. There is no harm in exploring your identity.</p>
      <p>You don't need dysphoria to be trans and there is no one right way to be transgender. Just be your best, most authentic self.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.transgendermap.com/welcome/for-questioning-readers/">For gender questioning people</a><p>A starting place for many of the common questions. Reminds you that you are not alone.</p></li>

      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="row linkList">
      <h2>Exploring Identity</h2>
      <p>There is no one way to explore identity. It is a unique experience for everyone. In truth, I have never met someone who was entirely 100% confident about their identity all of the time - especially right away. It is okay to be uncertain and explore things.</p>
      <p>You can try on new labels or identities to yourself, with a partner, in a friend group, or with the whole world. There is no obligation to commit to any one thing. It is perfectly normal to not get everything 100% correct the first time.</p>
      <p>Exploring your identity can be scary and difficult. But there are spaces to support you. Try to find the spaces and resources that work best for you.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.pronouns.failedslacker.com/">Pronoun Dressing room</a><p>A site where you can test out new pronouns and names.</p></li>

      </ul>
      <div class="linkList">
        <h3> Coming Out </h3>
        <p> Coming out as trans is incredibly difficult and scary. Remember that there is no obligation to come out until you are ready to do so. You also don't have to come out to everyone at once. There is a huge trans community to support you through the process.</p>
        <p style=display:inline>I recommend looking through the <a href=ally.html>ally resource list</a> to get an idea of what kinds of questions you might need answers to.
          <ul>

In my experience, it helped to have more academic resources. You can see the ally resources, but also more specifically I have listed some below:</p></li>

      </div>
      <div class="row linkList">
        <h2>Community</h2>
        <p>Community support from other trans people is a key part of many trans people's success. Below are just some resources. There are support groups and social scenes all over the world, some are just harder to find than others. Asking a therapist, other trans people, and looking on social media are great places to start.</p>

        <h2>Transition & Expression</h2>
        <p>There is no one way to transition or be trans. But below are some common resources that might be handy for exploring your identity and finding a more comfortable sense of self.</p>
        <ul>

          <h3> Clothing & Accessories </h3>
          <p> Clothing can be a great place to express identity and feel gender euphoria. The best part is that clothes are not permament, so there is no harm in trying something new.</p>

          <h3> Voice Feminiziation Training </h3>
          <p>Feminizing hormones don't have an effect on vocal patterns. If you are interested in voice training below are some resources.</p>
          <p> I briefly did voice training in the past, but grew tired of it and the activity made me dysphoric. Even without voice training, my voice has changed over time. As I have become more comfortable in my identity, I have expressed myself more and have developed a uniquely me voice with excitable, and traditionally "feminine" touches. My voice is not cis passing, but I have found real beauty in trans feminine voices.</p>
          <p>I share this story as a perspective of hope for if you are frustrated by voice training. There is beauty in trans feminine voices and they are not male voices. Nonetheless, there is also no shame in doing voice training if that is what feels best for you.</p>
