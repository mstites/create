      <h1> Trans Resources </h1>
      <p> Resources for transgender or questioning people. This is a work in progress. Please feel free to reach out with any suggestions or feedback. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="row linkList">
      <h2>Am I trans?</h2>
      <p> I am still looking for more resources in this area! But in short,  there is no one who can approve you as being trans. There is no test or trans judge who can tell you. Only you can truly know. As daunting as this sounds, you don't have to figure it all out at once.</p>
      <p>It is perfectly okay to explore labels/pronouns/names without any strings attached. You can come out as one thing to later discover you are another. There is no harm in exploring your identity.</p>
      <p>You don't need dysphoria to be trans and there is no one right way to be transgender. Just be your best, most authentic self.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="row linkList">
      <h2>Exploring Identity</h2>
      <p>There is no one way to explore identity. It is a unique experience for everyone. In truth, I have never met someone who was entirely 100% confident about their identity all of the time - especially right away. It is okay to be uncertain and explore things.</p>
      <p>You can try on new labels or identities to yourself, with a partner, in a friend group, or with the whole world. There is no obligation to commit to any one thing. It is perfectly normal to not get everything 100% correct the first time.</p>
      <p>Exploring your identity can be scary and difficult. But there are spaces to support you. Try to find the spaces and resources that work best for you.</p>
