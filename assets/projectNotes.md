# Project Notes
Notes document for site maintainers to keep track of design tasked and planned content.

## Action items
Design:

Content:
1. Add computer build
2. Organize trans resources

Should keep trans resources, but they probably need to be reordered.
Trans 101, which can be linked on home page. Some sort of dictionary or trans guide in reading.

Could have a main list of resources, then have a list with all the resources. Have a starting place with my favorite resources and emphasis the really good stuff.
