        Who said engineers had to be all serious?
      </p>
      <p>
        Between my coffee, hackathon style project work, and excited nerd talk in the dorms - I sometimes find it necessary to escape the engineering nerd cave and dart into the artistic, social justice, creative caverns of my brain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Create is a viewport into the works that come out of these personal "retreats." The site features works which draw heavily on my lived experiences as a lesbian, poly, trans woman.
      </p>
      <!-- Could have image of retreats, viewport -->
      <p>
        Notably, a <a href="zines.html">Zines and Writing</a> page which feature collections of my poetry, short essays, and journals from different stages in my trans experience; providing an unfiltered take on my experiences with transphobia, transmisogyny, homophobia, and sexism.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the future, I hope to create and share more work focusing on trans positivity, allyship, and broader social justice. In a sense, the work I create (and by extension, the site), follows my transition. As I find ways to cope with my marginalized identities, I feel that my work will  shift accordingly.
