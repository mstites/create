      <h1> Zines and Writing </h1>
      <p>
        A small sample of the zines I have written, mostly focusing on my experiences with gender discrimination and dysphoria. I plan on creating new updated poetry zines in the near future, as well as compiling some of my other writings into zine format.

        <a href="/assets/img/zine/pdf/dearRugby.pdf"><h3>Dear Rugby</h3></a>
        <p>An open letter to USA Rugby and more widely the systematic transphobia that prevents me from engaging in sports like everyone else.</p>
        <p>In this zine, I air my frustrations navigating sports as a trans woman and address many of the common arguments against allowing trans women their rightful place in women's sports.</p>

        <h3>Euphoria</h3>
        <p>Joins the <a href="/assets/img/zine/pdf/dysphoria.pdf">Dysphoria</a> and <a href="/assets/img/zine/pdf/transphobia.pdf">Transphobia</a> zines as the final piece in the series. </p>
        <p>I wanted "Euphoria" to provide a positive ending and bring a sense of conclusion to the series. In the end, I focused the zine on my exploration finding positivity, pride, and joy in being transgender despite all the hardship. </p>

        <h3>Transphobia</h3>
        <p>A collection of poetry and short essays formed in the fashion of letters addressed to specific forms of harassment and oppresion I have experienced as a trans woman.</p>
        <p>The second zine in a series of three zines, joined by <a href="/assets/img/zine/pdf/dysphoria.pdf">Dysphoria</a> and <a href="/assets/img/zine/pdf/euphoria.pdf">Euphoria</a>. This zine in particular focused on addressing deep rooted trauma.</p>

        <h3>Dysphoria</h3>
        <p>A collection of some of the first gender poetry I ever wrote. I originally hesitated uploading this zine to the site, as I was still very early in my trans journey and still very confused on where I was headed.</p>
        <p>However, I decided it is important not to be ashamed or try to hide any part of my trans experience. Confusion and change are often essential steps of gender exploration - and I want to help normalize that.</p>
        <p>The Dysphoria zine ended up turning into a three zine series, later joined by <a href="/assets/img/zine/pdf/transphobia.pdf">Transphobia</a> and <a href="/assets/img/zine/pdf/euphoria.pdf">Euphoria</a>.</p>
